## ℹ️ Overview

Hey there! We are a team of aspiring iOS developers, and this app is our first big project. It started off as a final project for the HSE's Summer School, where we got inspired and decided to push it further, making it a great tool for everybody, including us.
When learning a new language, you always encounter an opinion that reading is by far one of the most powerful ways to improve your skills (and it is totally legit!). The problem is, there are tons of sources, from world-famous publishers and magazines to platforms like Substack and Bluesky. Our goal is to drastically reduce the time that searching through all those sources requires, bringing a simple and comprehensive tool for reading interesting articles whihe keeping track of your progress.
